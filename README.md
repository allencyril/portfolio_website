PORTFOLIO WEBSITE\n
Welcome to the repository for my MERN stack portfolio website project! Here, you'll find the codebase for the dynamic platform I built using MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js. Explore the code and feel free to contribute or provide feedback. 
This website is deployed using netlify -- https://allencyril.netlify.app/
